# 🍛 FoodClassification

This repository contains the codebase for a scientific article/thesis focused on building a lightweight and accurate image classification model for traditional Indonesian foods using **MobileNetV3**. The model is trained and evaluated on a diverse dataset of local cuisines to demonstrate the real-world application of deep learning in culturally relevant domains.

The model is trained using the **Indonesia Food 42 Dataset**, which consists of over 18,000 images across 42 categories of Indonesian cuisine.
